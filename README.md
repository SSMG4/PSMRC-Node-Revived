# PSMRC-Node Revived
A dead Heroku website made to convert Minecraft Resource Packs to PSVita Resource Packs brought back to life with GitHub Pages 

Remember to support <a href="https://github.com/psiie/PSMRC-Node">the original project</a>, even though its dead now

All credits to <a href="https://github.com/psiie/">psiie</a>, the creator of the original project. She also made <a href="https://github.com/psiie/PSMRC">PSMRC</a> which is the same project but its code instead of a webpage, go check it out!

EDIT: Ive made my searches and concluded this would be the last update for this project, because no bugs have been found on my part. If you do find bugs and errors, issues are still open for everyone and will be seen by me!

Final Update: 2025.06.27
