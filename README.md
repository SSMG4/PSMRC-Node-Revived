# PSMRC-Node Revived
A dead Heroku website made to convert Minecraft Resource Packs to PSVita Resource Packs brought back to life with GitHub Pages 

Remember to support <a href="https://github.com/psiie/PSMRC-Node">the original project</a>, even though it might be dead now

All credits to <a href="https://github.com/psiie">Psiie/Indigoferra</a>, the creator of the original project. She also made <a href="https://github.com/psiie/PSMinecraft-Resource-Converter">PSMRC</a>, which is basically the same project but made as an application instead of a website, go check it out!

EDIT: An update was made to the README of the original project detailing how to run the tool locally yourself, which can be pretty useful considering the website for it is dead
EDIT2: Ive in the end found bugs and have decided to update them to make the project more clean!

Latest Update: 2025.09.10
